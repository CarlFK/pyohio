Stuff to do

This is Matt's opinionated list, not something official.

Sooner
======

*   Show the length of talks on the site on the review page and
    elsewhere

*   Make it easy for submitters to cancel their submission through the
    site

*   Add some talk statuses like "confirmed for standby" and "confirmed
    for accepted".

*   Make it easy for admin team to cancel a submission.

*   Make some postgresql views that can be easily dumped to CSV files
    that can be accessed from the site.

    Could use triggers on underlying tables, or listen/notify, or a cron
    job.



Later
=====

*   Rewrite the database to be less ridiculous.
