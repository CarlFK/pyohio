Stuff to do

This is Matt's opinionated list, not something official. You do what you
want.

Sooner
======

*   Show the length of talks on the site on the review page and
    elsewhere

*   Make it easy for submitters to cancel their submission through the
    site

*   Add some talk statuses like "confirmed for standby" and "confirmed
    for accepted".

*   Make it easy for admin team to cancel a submission.

*   Make some postgresql views that can be easily dumped to CSV files
    that can be accessed from the site.

    We could use triggers on underlying tables, or listen/notify, or a
    cron job.

*   Make it easy for talk submitters to describe scheduling preferences
    and hard limits.

*   Show more information on the list of talks screen.  For example,
    show the status, the count of votes, the aggregate score, etc.

    And make it easy to change statuses of talks from

Later
=====

*   Rewrite the database to be less ridiculous.

*   Replace +1, +0, -0, -1 with some far more obvious.  Probably just
    VOTE or PASS
